Total War is an open source Sea Battle game developed in elixir.

The Game so Far has 6 Ships to select from with an expansive board size for multiple defence force players.

  -Submarine
  -Destroyer
  -Frigate
  -Aircraft Carrier
  -Patrol Boat
  -Tactical Boat

Total War Aim:
The Project Aim is to have a free open source game that is playable for community based turns

The way the turns will work:
-Everyone picks a team and then the summation of the turns are calculated, the highest turn will be chosen for that team

Game A.I ->
I am creating a game ai that you can play against and it can set it's own placement for the ships.

TO DO LIST:
 * Make Database Relations `Complete`
 * Make Ship Structs `Complete`
 * Make AI Placement for Horizontal `Complete`
 * Make AI Placement for Vertical
 * Make Target Checker and Valid Move Checker `Complete`
 * Make Turn AI System

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
